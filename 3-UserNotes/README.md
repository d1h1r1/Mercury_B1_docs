## 4 Frequently Asked Questions

### How to Ask Questions Gracefully

#### 1 When asking questions in various places, you may encounter the following phenomena:

- No response after asking a question.
- The question is answered after a long time.
- The other party always complains that you are too inexperienced.

#### 2 Before asking a question, make sure you have studied this manual.

Many questions will be resolved in this process. Avoid asking questions in QQ groups, forums, issues, or emails right from the start. Many questions explained in the documentation may not receive timely responses from the community. To save everyone's time and create a better community environment, please understand each other and grow together.

#### 3 When asking questions, try to do the following, which will greatly increase the chances of quickly resolving the issue:

##### Clarify what happened and what you did, including:

- What effect or function do I want to achieve?
- How did I do it to achieve this effect, and what was the specific process?
- What errors occurred during the implementation, and what were the phenomena (e.g., what was the reported error, and what was the **complete** error content)?
- Did I carefully read the error message, and did the error message suggest the cause and solution?
- Based on these error messages, can I solve the problem myself?
- Can I find a solution to the problem by searching the documentation, issues, and search engines?

#### 4 If you really cannot solve the problem yourself and need help, consider:

- Whom to ask, where to ask, who is more likely to answer my question, and what is the real-time nature?
- What data and phenomena should I provide to make the person willing to quickly help me solve the problem?
  - Provide my purpose (to let the responder know what you are doing)
  - Provide the complete implementation process and the phenomena that occurred during the process (to allow the responder to follow your process and reproduce the problem)
  - Point out the error and indicate where the phenomenon or result differs from my expectations (to let the responder know where it did not meet expectations)
  - Provide the error message, which needs to be complete, with as many screenshots and logs as possible. Do not be stingy with a small screenshot or only provide part of the log (because the responder may not have done this for a long time and may have forgotten some details, they need to quickly recall through screenshots and complete logs; and detailed logs can quickly locate the problem)

- How to ask questions in a way that appears sincere, so that even if I am inexperienced, everyone is willing to answer

#### 5 Question Template

Try to ask questions gracefully, without adding unnecessary tone words or complaints. Carefully consider each word and punctuation mark, and think from the responder's perspective about how to quickly help solve the problem. Too few words may not describe the problem clearly, while too many words may make people lose patience.

#### 6 Title

Whether asking questions in QQ groups or elsewhere, give your question a title of about 30 words that clarifies the central idea of the problem, including:

- The type of question, whether it is a question, a bug report, or an experience sharing, etc. This allows people to immediately understand what you want to do in a screen full of text.
- A sentence that clarifies the central idea of the problem, such as "Running the camera example program, error reset fail, could it be a hardware issue?"

So, a comprehensive title could be:

- "【mercury question】 Running the camera example program, error reset fail, could it be a hardware issue?"

Avoid titles like:

- "Ahhh, why is my board not working again"
- "Why can't my code run"
- "Why is my screen black"
- "【mercury question】 Received the development board, the screen is red with a line of small text, why?"
- "I ran the xxx program, and there was a problem"

You can ask like this:

- "【mercury question】 My board cannot start after I connected the power supply incorrectly. How can I determine where the board is damaged, and if possible, how can I fix it?"

#### 7 Content

First, from the responder's perspective, if asked a question:

- First, know what the other party wants to do and what their goal is.
- What steps did they follow to achieve this goal?
- What specific steps did they take, and at what step did the problem occur, so I can try to reproduce the phenomenon by following their steps? If the problem seems difficult to solve and there are no reproduction steps, it may take a lot of time to reproduce, so I will solve other problems first.
- What is the specific problem? If they only say there is a problem, how do I know what the problem is? Maybe they are feeling unwell? So, it is very important to explain the phenomenon when the problem occurs and point out where it differs from expectations. Otherwise, I have to guess and compare with expectations, which increases the time to solve the problem.
- When a problem occurs, I may need their log files to analyze the source code, etc. Otherwise, it may be difficult to solve the problem, so I will put this problem aside for now.

In summary, you can ask questions like this:

- Clearly state your goal, what you want to achieve, and what the phenomenon should be.
- Did I refer to any documentation, code, or tutorials?
- How to reproduce the error: specifically, what steps were taken, write each step in detail until the problem occurs.
- Clearly describe the phenomenon when the error occurs and where it differs from expectations, proving that the problem indeed occurred.
- Attach log files, screenshots, and even videos. Logs and screenshots must be complete, not just a small part. The responder may find some issues you did not notice from your complete logs and screenshots, which is very important.
- Additionally, paste the code with proper formatting to ensure it is readable and can be run directly.
- Finally, express gratitude to the community members who help answer your questions.

### Driver Related

#### 1 About Python

**Q: What do the parameters in the API send_base_coords([x, y, z, rx, ry, rz], speed) mean? What do rx, ry, and rz correspond to in Euler angles? What is the rotation order of Euler angles? What is the range of each parameter?**

- A: The parameters in the array are the coordinates of the Mercury B1 end, and speed is the velocity. rx, ry, and rz correspond to RPY, which are roll, pitch, and yaw, respectively. The order of Euler angles is zyx, and zyx is its own coordinate. The range of x, y, z is -350~350, -350~350, -41~523.9 (undefined range, if exceeded, inverse kinematics will return no solution). The range of rx, ry, rz is -180~180.

**Q: Are the Python APIs the same for different versions of the robotic arm?**

- A: The APIs are the same.

#### 2 About ROS
**Q: Can you provide the rviz model files and programming examples?**

- A: They can be found on our GitHub.
“https://github.com/elephantrobotics/mercury_ros”

**Q: Why do I get a permission error “/dev/ttyUSB0” when starting the rviz model file using ROS?**

- A: This is because the serial port permission is not granted. You should type sudo chmod 777 port name in the terminal.
  For example:
  ```
  sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0
  ```

**Q: Why do I get the error \_init_() takes exactly 2 arguments (3 given) when running the ROS slider control and the model follows the command?**

- A: The pymercury library is not installed and started.

**Q: Why does the mercury_B1 angle not match the model angle after opening the rviz model when using ROS?**

- A: It is likely that the zero position of mercury_B1 is not calibrated, and the zero position of mercury_B1 needs to be calibrated.

### Software Issues

#### About ROS1

**Q: When switching to ~/catkin_ws/src in the terminal and using git to install or update mercury_ros, the target path “mercury_ros” already exists. What is the reason?**

- A: This means that there is already a “mercury_ros” package in ~/catkin_ws/src. You need to delete it in advance and then re-execute the git operation.

**Q: When running rosrun, the terminal error prompts “could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: Permission: '/dev/ttyUSB0'”. Why?**

- A: Insufficient serial port permissions. Enter “sudo chmod 777 /dev/ttyUSB0” in the terminal to grant permissions.

**Q: Why can't ROS programs run in VSCode?**

- A: Because the VSCode terminal cannot load into the ROS environment, you need to run it in the system terminal.

**Q: When running rosrun, the terminal prompts “Unable to register with master node [http://localhost:11311]: master may not be running yet. Will keep trying.” What is the reason?**

- A: Before running the ROS program, you need to open the ROS node by entering “roscore” in the terminal.

**Q: When running rosrun, the terminal error prompts “could not open port /dev/ttyUSB0: No such file or directory: '/dev/ttyUSB1'”. Why?**

- A: Serial port error. You need to confirm the actual serial port of the current robotic arm. You can check it by `ls /dev/tty*`.

**Q: In Ubuntu 18.04, 'catkin_make' fails to build the code, and the terminal prompts 'Project 'cv_bridge' specifies '/usr/include/opencv' as an include directory, which is not found. And other error messages.**

- A: The OpenCV path in the configuration file does not match the actual system path. You need to use the sudo command to modify the configuration file (path is “/opt/ros/melodic/share/cv_bridge/cmake/cv_bridgeConfig.cmake”). The actual OpenCV path of the system is under the “/usr/include/” path.

**Q: Simply cloning the mercury_ros package and then directly running the rosrun program results in errors such as “package 'mercury_ros' not found” or errors like files not found?**

- A: The newly cloned mercury_ros needs to build the ROS environment compiled code. Enter in the terminal:

```
bash
cd ~/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

#### About Robotic Arm Control

**Q: The robotic arm does not move when sending angles or coordinates to it.**

- A: Use `get_angles()` to read the angles of the robotic arm. If the angles return empty, check if the robotic arm is powered on, and use `power_on()` to enable the robotic arm; check if the port number is used correctly.
If there are angles, check if the angles exceed the movement range as shown in Table 1. If they exceed the range, use `release_all_servos()` to relax all joints (note that the joints will fall after relaxation, so catch them), align the zero scale lines of joints 1~5, 7, and make joint 6 perpendicular to the zero scale line by 90 degrees. Then use `focus_all_servos()` to lock the joints, and use `set_servo_calibration(1)~set_servo_calibration(7)` to calibrate the zero points of each joint in sequence. Then use `get_angles()` to read the current joint angles. If the returned data is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 90, 0], the calibration is successful. Otherwise, repeat the previous calibration steps.

<center> Table 1-1 Joint Angle Movement Range</center>

|   Joint   | Range   |
|  :----:  | :----:  |
| J1  | -175 ~ +175 |
| J2  | -65 ~ +115 |
| J3| -175 ~ +175 |
| J4  | -180 ~ +10 |
| J5| -175 ~ +175 |
| J6| -20 ~ + 173 |
| J7| -180 ~ +180 |

**Q: The camera cannot be opened.**

- A: Open the local camera to see if it can switch to the left and right arm cameras. If a certain camera cannot be viewed, re-plug the USB port or change the USB port.
If it can switch to the left and right cameras, check if the camera port has changed (the port may change after restarting).

**Q: The adaptive gripper cannot be controlled.**

- A: Check the power indicator of the adaptive gripper. The indicator should be steady on when normal. If the indicator flashes, re-plug the connection cable between the gripper and the robotic arm. If the indicator returns to steady on, it is normal.
If the indicator is steady on but still cannot be controlled, use `set_gripper_mode(0)` to change the gripper usage mode.

### Hardware Issues

#### 1 About Structure

**Q: What is the role of Atom in the robotic arm?**

- A: Atom mainly controls the kinematic algorithms of the robotic arm, including forward and inverse kinematics, solution selection, acceleration and deceleration, speed synchronization, multi-power interpolation, coordinate transformation, etc. Programs related to Atom are not yet open source.

**Q: The motor automatically cuts off power during use. Why?**

- A: The motor has overheat protection for long-term use. This phenomenon is normal and can be used again after a few minutes.

#### 2 About Parameters

**Q: What is the speed unit of the robotic arm?**

- A: The running speed is 180 degrees/second.

**Q: Can the adaptive gripper not be fully closed?**

- A: There will be a certain gap between the jaws, and they are not fully closed. You can adjust it by increasing the thickness of the gap between them.

**Q: How to fix the USB camera at the end of the robotic arm?**

- A: It needs to be fixed with a flange, which can be purchased separately.
